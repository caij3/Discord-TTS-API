# Discord-TTS-API
A small code snippet that is able to send Discord messages using Speech Recognition.

# Setup
To use, first create a webhook for a Discord channel (note you will need admin or mod role). Click on the "Edit channel" button next to the channel you want to edit.

Next, click on Integrations -> Webhooks -> New Webhook.

This will generate a new webhook that you can use to send messages. Click on the dropdown for the webhook and click "Copy Webhook URL".
Paste the copied webhook url in the "Enter_Webhook_Url_here" section of the code.

Then run the python script and say the message you want to send when you hear the "Listening" audio cue
